# hello-world -- A novice coder's portfolio

## 2022_05_11 Update
* Since starting this repo, I have gotten a new computer. I have not yet replaced the windows os on this machine, so there is less focus on scripting, unless I can learn the windows commands. _This'll be hard b/c I like unix commands_
* I have been using this repository as a place to collectively hold all of my coding adventures, be that scratch code, for a one-off calculation, or creating  projectes inspired by the lessons at freecodecamp.org and at W3 schools.
* Here is a summary folders within this repo as it stands now. *italicized script will have descriptions of the folder's purpose*

## 2022_02_18_Edits
* I am now making this a public repository, just in case I 
  *  loose access to this email address
  *  decide that I want input from other people.
*  By the time I am ready for other people to look at it, I'll change the name from hello-world to a more descriptive title.
*  When I allow strangers to edit this, I will allow forks, but no direct edits to my code-base, unless I there is a specific reason for requesting help.


## 2022_02_11_TestRepository
This is a repository that I have created following the tutorial. I am using it as a refresher on how to appropriately use a git.

## Goals
* This is mostly a playground.
* This particular repository is kept on private.
* Ultimately, I want to have a portfolio of stuff I've done.
* Can I use github to host a webpage?
* Can I create a piece of software that runs?
* What about making my python maze-code function?


## About Me
* Professionally, I am a materials engineer
* I have a passion for data visualization
* I want to be better at web dev.
* This is my playground.
