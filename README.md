# hello-world


## 2022_02_11_TestRepository
This is a repository that I have created following the tutorial. I am using it as a refresher on how to appropriately use a git.

## Goals
* This is mostly a playground.
* This particular repository is kept on private.
* Ultimately, I want to have a portfolio of stuff I've done.
* Can I use github to host a webpage?
* Can I create a piece of software that runs?
* What about making my python maze-code function?


## About Me
* Professionally, I am a materials engineer
* I have a passion for data visualization
* I want to be better at web dev.
* This is my playground.
